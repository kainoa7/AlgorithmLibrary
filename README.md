# Algorithm Repository Description

# Description
Welcome to my Algorithm Repository, a comprehensive collection of algorithms discussed in class. This repository serves as a valuable resource for understanding, implementing, and experimenting with various algorithms. Some algorithms include Dijkstra, Interval Partitioning, Interval Scheduling, and Merge and Sort. Each algorithm is organized into its own repository, complete with a detailed README providing insights into its functionality, implementation, and potential applications. 


# Algorithms Included: 
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm: This classic algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph, making it indispensable in network routing and optimization problems.
2. Interval Scheduling: This algorithm tackles scheduling tasks within a given time frame to maximize resource utilization, widely applied in job scheduling and project management.
3. Interval Partitioning: Interval partitioning algorithm addresses the task of scheduling within a given time frame to minimize resource conflicts.
4. Merge and count algorithm provides a solution for counting inversions in an array, essential for sorting and optimization problems.

# Repository Structure
Each algorithm resides in its own repository, allowing for easy navigation and individual exploration. The main page of this repository serves as a hub, providing quick access to each algorithm's repository through relevant links.
