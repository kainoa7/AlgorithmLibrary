# Algorithm Repository Description

# Description
Welcome to the Algorithm Repository, a comprehensive collection of algorithms discussed in our classes. This repository serves as a valuable resource for understanding, implementing, and experimenting with various algorithms, ranging from fundamental concepts like Dijkstra's algorithm to more complex ones like the Knapsack problem solver. Each algorithm is meticulously organized into its own repository, complete with a detailed README providing insights into its functionality, implementation, and potential applications. 


# Algorithms Included: 
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm: This classic algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph, making it indispensable in network routing and optimization problems.
2. Closest Points: An algorithmic solution for finding the closest pair of points among a set, crucial in computational geometry and pattern recognition.
3. Interval Scheduling: This algorithm tackles scheduling tasks within a given time frame to maximize resource utilization, widely applied in job scheduling and project management.
4. Knapsack Problem Solver: A dynamic programming approach to the Knapsack problem, where items with certain values and weights must be selected to maximize the total value within a weight constraint, extensively used in optimization and resource allocation scenarios.

# Repository Structure
